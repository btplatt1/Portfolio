# [Project 1: Analyzing Students' Mental Health](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/39022bcc-2cdd-4a1a-a8f9-abaa703b02e9/edit)

This is a simple project I did for my Data Analyst in SQL Certification, where I explore and analyze data to see how the length of stay impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.

* Project explores 'students' dataset using PostgreSQL
* Queries basic syntax, aggregates, filtering, sorting and grouping.
